### Development features

- Supports for `Python 3.9` and higher.
- [`Poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/) as the dependencies manager. See configuration in [`pyproject.toml`](https://github.com/zsz_prz/reduce/reduce/blob/master/pyproject.toml) and [`setup.cfg`](https://github.com/zsz_prz/reduce/reduce/blob/master/setup.cfg).
- Automatic codestyle with [`black`](https://github.com/psf/black), [`isort`](https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort) and [`pyupgrade`](https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade).
- Ready-to-use [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks with code-formatting.
- Type checks with [`mypy`](https://mypy.readthedocs.io); docstring checks with [`darglint`](https://github.com/terrencepreilly/darglint); security checks with [`safety`](https://github.com/pyupio/safety) and [`bandit`](https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit)
- Testing with [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/).
- Ready-to-use [`.editorconfig`](https://github.com/zsz_prz/reduce/reduce/blob/master/.editorconfig), [`.dockerignore`](https://github.com/zsz_prz/reduce/reduce/blob/master/.dockerignore), and [`.gitignore`](https://github.com/zsz_prz/reduce/reduce/blob/master/.gitignore). You don't have to worry about those things.
